# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Player can choose out of three options: rock, paper and scissors against a randomly chosen option. 


## Inspiration 
Rock paper scissors is a classic from childhood which is why I themed it around a playground.
Wanted to add a twist to it so I recreated the rock paper scissors variant from Squid Game season 2.


## Challenges 
1. Constantly updating the images and stats related to a certain difficulty.
2. Coding the special rock paper scissors mode to be semi-compatible with the base one.
3. Keeping track of many different yet similarly named elements. (variables, ids, functions)
4. Visually positioning everything trough trial and error.


## What I've learned
In this project I really wanted to integrate my creativity in the visual and in the code systems which taught many things.

1. Need more differentiation and creativity when naming things.
2. Create a functional prototype before working on the visual.
3. Thoroughly plan out how to code something and how to integrate the other mechanics into it.
4. Actively modyfying visual and functional elements. (Images, variables for elements)
